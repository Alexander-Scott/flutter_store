# Flutter Store - A guide to creating a generic store using Flutter and Firebase

In this repository you will find an example of a store, created using Flutter and Firebase. Store in this regard refers to a platform which allows users to push content and other users to pull that content. This is a generic solution but could be tailored towards a specific type of content, such as an App Store, Item store, Photo Gallery, Social Network, etc. All of these examples have content that is pushed and pulled by users.

This README contains a moderately detailed guide on how this example was created, broken down into various steps. Each step will correlate to a branch in this repository where you can browse the code if you so wish.
